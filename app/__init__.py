# Suppress a specific DeprecationWarning from geopandas._compat.
# This warning is related to an internal import in geopandas (version 1.0.1)
# that still uses `shapely.geos`, which is deprecated in Shapely 2.x.
# Geopandas 1.0.1 is the latest stable version and is intended for Shapely 2.x,
# so this warning is an internal matter for geopandas and does not affect
# our application's functionality. It is suppressed to keep logs clean.
# This can be removed if a future geopandas version resolves the internal import.

# --- IMPORTANT NOTE (VIKTOR SDK v14 Compatibility) ---
# The 'InitialEntity' class below is deprecated in SDK v14+ and should ideally
# be replaced by assigning a list of dictionaries directly to 'viktor.initial_entities'.
# Example recommended format:
# viktor.initial_entities = [
#     {"entity_type_name": "OverviewBridges", "is_initial_entity": True},
# ]
# However, attempts to use the recommended format resulted in persistent runtime errors:
# "App specification is invalid: You should provide at least 1 top level entity when using tree app type."
# This occurred despite correct syntax and environment restarts (SDK 14.20.0, Connector 6.4.0).
# Therefore, the deprecated 'InitialEntity' is used here as a temporary workaround.
# The MyPy error for the 'InitialEntity' import is suppressed above using '# type: ignore[attr-defined]'.
# This situation should be revisited if the SDK or connector is updated.
# --- END NOTE ---
